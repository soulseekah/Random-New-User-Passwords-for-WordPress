Simple (for now) plugin to generate a random password when creating a new user from the Dashboard.

== Description ==

Inspired by [http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic/random-password-for-new-users](http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic/random-password-for-new-users) and a couple of hours of free time, this JavaScript-powered plugin adds a button to the Add User screen, which, when clicked, generates a strong random password for your new user. This should shave off a couple of seconds of your time when creating a new user.

Props to [@lorenzopopov](http://twitter.com/lorenzopopov) for the random dice image.

== Installation ==

Nothing special.

1. Upload plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Generate secure random passwords

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Only if you really want to.

= How do I get it to...? =

Doesn't do much at the moment. Send over your feature requests or even code and they'll be implemented as soon as possible.
